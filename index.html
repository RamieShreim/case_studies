						<h1>UX Case Study: WCS</h1>

						<a name="our_goal"></a>

						<h2>Our Goal</h2>

						<p>The WCS, or "Wildlife Conservation Society" is a non-profit organization dedicated to the protection of wildlife. They are a global organization, operating in over 65 countries.
							They also own many zoos and an aquarium. As succesful as they are, surprisingly enough, their website leaves a lot to be desired. So as a team, Justin Blake, Theresa Hoang, and I created
							a prototype for what an improved WCS website could look like. Unfortunately, the WCS themselves weren't keen on the idea of giving us any useful information to start with. But through careful
							research and a lot of testing, we were able to create a mockup that improves upon the WCS' current design. </p>

					<a name="heuristic_analysis">

						<h2>Heuristic Analysis</h2>

						<p> Looking at their current site, its plain to see that there is room for improvement. Why does it have this big fat side navigation? Why not have it on the top like most other websites?
							The way images are stitched together here doesn't really look nice on desktop, and there are three big competing headlines screaming right at you from the start. None of which really inform 
							you what the WCS is about other then the fact that they have something to do with animals.  </p>

							<p> <br> <br> <br> On some parts of the website, they even have a side navigation and a top navigation. 
								Why is that? Why not have the global nav and the primary nav stacked on top of each other? framing the content of the page like this just seems sort of odd. </p>

					<!---Second Old Wcs Image-->

						<p> <br> <br> <br> Their donation page doesn't seem too bad. But the footer is always peeking up from the bottom a little bit for some reason. No matter where you are on the page the very top of the footer
						follows you, and this is just awful. The footer is of no use if you can't see the whole thing, and it just gets in the way. On the bright side, we loved the way their donation process actually worked. The buttons 
					are simple, eye catching, and informative. Making a donation is relatively painless and this page actually looks pretty good on mobile. But on desktop it definely needs a rework.  </p>

				<!---UX Research-->
				<section class="bio_text">
					<a name="ux_research">

						<h2>UX Research</h2>

						<p> With nothing to go off of from the WCS themselves, we began our research from scratch. Conducting interviews, gathering survey data, and testing the current website with various users.
							We then synthesized that data into an affinity diagram, created a user persona, and a storyboard. We found through our research that many people are interested in wildlife conservation.
							However, a lot of them, especially younger people, would rather volunteer or sign petitions than donate. As far as UI is concerned, many of our testers had the same issues with the website that we did and
							almost all of them complained about the navigation.

					<a name="lofi_mockups">

						<h2>Low Fidelity Mockups</h2>
						<p> We decided that the goal of our prototype should be to entice people to contribute in any way they can. Not only with donations, but also through inexspensive means such as volunteering
							and signing petitions. Primarily, we wanted to make this quick, easy, and in a way that doesn't take you away from browsing the rest of the website. <br> <br>

							The user flow pictured below demonstrates our intended interaction with the website. Ideally, at any point during someones visit they should be able to do something productive.

						<p> <br> <br>  From what we saw on the website previously, the donation process is actually fairly short. So we decided we wanted to scrap the donation page in favor of a modal.
						The idea being that getting through the process on a modal with a couple of quick forms would flow well with the experience of browsing articles. This also let you get right back to what you were doing when you're 
						done donating. This is good not only because its pleasant, but the longer you stick around the more likely you are to do something else. Like signing a petition or signing up to volunteer. In the images below you
						can see a quick paper sketch and a low fidelity mockup of the modal. You can also see that we scrapped the sidebar on desktop.   </p>

				<section class="bio_text">
	
						<p> <br> We actually wanted to put volunteering and petition signing on modals too. But it became very apparent that each of those causes warranted its own page,
						so we opted for just having a clearer call to action on each of them instead. </p>
