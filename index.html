						<h2>Our Goal <img class="section_icons" src="images/flag.png"></h2>

						<p>The WCS, or "Wildlife Conservation Society" is a non-profit organization dedicated to the
							protection of wildlife. They are a global organization, operating in over 65 countries.
							They also own many zoos and an aquarium. As successful as they are, surprisingly enough,
							their website leaves a lot to be desired. So as a team, Justin Blake, Theresa Hoang, and I
							created
							a prototype for what an improved WCS website could look like. Unfortunately, the WCS
							themselves weren't keen on the idea of giving us any useful information to start with. But
							through careful
							research and a lot of testing, we were able to create a mockup that improves upon the WCS'
							current design. </p>

						<h2>Heuristic Analysis <img class="section_icons" src="images/glass.png"></h2>

						<p> Looking at their current site, its plain to see that there is room for improvement. Why does
							it have this big fat side navigation? Why not have it on the top like most other websites?
							The way images are stitched together here doesn't really look nice on desktop, and there are
							three big competing headlines screaming right at you from the start. None of which really
							inform you what the WCS is about other than the fact that they have something to do with
							animals.

				<img class="study_img_container" id="study_img" src="images/wcsold.png">

				<section class="bio_text">

					<p> <br> <br> <br> On some parts of the website, they even have a side navigation and a top
						navigation.
						Why is that? Why not have the global nav and the primary nav stacked on top of each other?
						framing the content of the page like this just seems sort of odd. </p>

				</section>

				<!---Second Old Wcs Image-->
				<img class="study_img_container" id="study_img" src="images/wcsold2.png">

				<section class="bio_text">

					<p> <br> <br> <br> Their donation page doesn't seem too bad. But the footer is always peeking up
						from the bottom a little bit for some reason. No matter where you are on the page the very top
						of the footer
						follows you, and this is just awful. The footer is of no use if you can't see the whole thing,
						and it just gets in the way. On the bright side, we loved the way their donation process
						actually worked. The buttons
						are simple, eye catching, and informative. Making a donation is relatively painless and this
						page actually looks pretty good on mobile. But on desktop it definitely needs a rework. </p>

					<a name="ux_research">

						<h2>UX Research <img class="section_icons" src="images/book.png"></h2>

						<p> With nothing to go off of from the WCS themselves, we began our research from scratch.
							Conducting interviews, gathering survey data, and testing the current website with various
							users.
							We then synthesized that data into an affinity diagram, created a user persona, and a
							storyboard. We found through our research that many people are interested in wildlife
							conservation.
							However, a lot of them, especially younger people, would rather volunteer or sign petitions
							than donate. As far as UI is concerned, many of our testers had the same issues with the
							website that we did and
							almost all of them complained about the navigation.

				<!--Lofi Mockups-->
				<section class="bio_text">
					<a name="lofi_mockups">

						<h2>Low Fidelity Mockups <img class="section_icons" src="images/woodsword.png"></h2>
						<p> We decided that the goal of our prototype should be to entice people to contribute in any
							way they can. Not only with donations, but also through inexpensive means such as
							volunteering and signing petitions. We wanted to make this quick, easy, and ensure that it
							doesn't take you away from browsing the rest of the website. <br> <br>

							The user flow pictured below demonstrates our intended interaction with the website.
							Ideally, at any point during someone's visit they should be able to do something to help the
							WCS.

				<section class="bio_text">

					<p> <br> <br> From what we saw on the website previously, the donation process is actually fairly
						short. So we decided to scrap the donation page in favor of a modal.
						The idea being that getting through the process on a modal with a couple of quick forms would
						flow well with the experience of browsing articles. This also let you get right back to what you
						were doing when you're
						done donating. This is good not only because it's pleasant, but the longer you stick around the
						more likely you are to do something else. Like signing a petition or signing up to volunteer. In
						the images below you
						can see a quick paper sketch and a low fidelity mockup of the modal. You can also see that we
						scrapped the sidebar on desktop. </p>

				<!---Lofi Modal-->
				<img class="study_img_container" id="study_img" src="images/lofi_modal.png">

				<section class="bio_text">

					<p> <br> We actually wanted to put volunteering and petition signing on modals too. But it became
						very apparent that each of those causes warranted its own page,
						so we opted for just having a clearer call to action on each of them instead. </p>

				</section>

				<!--Hifi Mockups-->
				<section class="bio_text">
					<a name="hifi_mockups">

						<h2>High Fidelity Mockups <img class="section_icons" src="images/sword.png"></h2>
						<p> After extensive testing on the previous prototype, we created high fidelity prototypes for
							both mobile and desktop versions of the website.
							This is the homepage on desktop: </p>
					</a>

				</section>

				<!---Desktop homepage-->
				<img class="study_img_container" id="study_img" src="images/hifi_desktop1.png">

				<section class="bio_text">

					<p> <br> <br> And here is an image of it on mobile: </p>

				</section>

				<!---Mobile Homepage-->
				<img class="study_img_container" id="study_img" src="images/mobile.png">

				<section class="bio_text">

					<p> So as you can see, we changed the website quite a bit in our design.
						We didn't really change the branding very much, but we changed the arrangement of the various
						elements on the page quite a bit.
						The images are arranged much better and each of them has a clear call to action. In particular,
						the hero image and text at the start of the page clearly and concisely
						tell you what the WCS stands for and prompts you to contribute immediately. On the desktop
						version of the prototype, each of these CTAs have their own page. I highly recommend
						that you try both of the prototypes for yourself. There's a lot more to them than the images I
						just showed you. There may yet still be room to improve this, but if this redesign was really
						going to be used, I think the changes we made would improve the site significantly.
