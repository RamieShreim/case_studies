					<h1>Ramie Shreim</h1>

					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<p> Hello! My name is Ramie and I'm a recent graduate from UCI's Claire Trevor School of the
						Arts. Ever since I was a child I loved to make things. Art, Games, you name it. If it
						exists, I've probably at least tried it. So it's only natural that I'd study art,
						however I found that studying art at UCI wasn't enough for me so I decided to continue my
						education and study UX design. My dream is to work with talented and creative people
						wherever that may be, and work together to make awesome things. I believe that through my
						experience working on various teams, at school and elsewhere, I've become a reliable teammate
						that can wear many hats and communicate effectively to deliver a good final product. And if
						there is something I don't understand, I do not hesitate to ask questions and I always adapt
						and learn. I've been called a "jack of all trades" a few times before, and I find that in UX
						design this is a very good quality to have. UX designers Do many things and communicate
						with people of all kinds of roles. </p>

					<h2>UX/UI Work</h2>

					<p> During my time at the UX/UI bootcamp, I learned everything I need to know about designing a
						responsive UI from start to finish. From basic UX priciples, to user research, to prototyping and testing, and prototyping and testing again. I've learned it all and I'm ready
						to start digging in and making great stuff. Of course, I've already got some neat designs under my belt! Key examples being this website,
						and <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/3GU4I5IH8D7#/screens/386041006">THIS</a>
						which is a mobile redesign of the Wildlife Conservation Societies website. </p>

					<h2>As An Artist</h2>

					<p> As stated before, for as long as I can remember I've always liked to make things. Throughout my life I've struggled on and off
						to make better drawings, and in more recent years, make better games. Currently in my off time I'm doing figure-drawing studies and I'm working on my first ever Steam-released game titled "Axe Girl" 
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm2yGIBNqks"> (early footage)</a>
						 I think my most "developed" art skill is drawing. But I have knowledge and skills on all kinds of art including: animation, painting, sculpture, 3D modeling, and now, web design!
						Though it is now my dream to work as a UX designer on an awesome team, my secondary goal is to be an art teacher for children part time. I think art education is important, and from my experience 
						I don't think there is enough of it, and often times programs that are designed to teach art can fail in certain areas. So I want to be a good example and hopefully the kids I teach will be better than me.  
					</p>



					<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
					<p> I was born on Pi day (march 14th) Despite this, I am still not very good at math. <br> <br>
						I was in the Video Game Development Club at UCI. <a
