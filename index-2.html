					<h2>Our Goal <img class="section_icons" src="images/flag.png"></h2>

					<p> The aim of this project was to create a prototype for an app that would
						act as a personal medical companion. PillPal would allow you to set reminders
						to take your medicine, keep track of your health status, and keep you in contact
						with doctors and caretakers. My partners, Julie Chau, Lu Xia, and I were passionate about the idea
						of creating an app that could help improve quality of life for people in need of consistent medical care.
						Although there are already many applications in use today that do a similar thing,
						we were determined to create a concept that was appealing, competitive, and practical.

						<h2>UX Research <img class="section_icons" src="images/book.png"></h2>

						<p> Creating an app from scratch requires a lot of data to know what features need to be included, how to set it
							apart from other apps, and what audience to target. So our research was very extensive given the short duration of the project (which was only a couple weeks.)
							In particular, in our user research we needed answers to these questions: 
						</p>

						<ul>

							<li>Who is our target audience?</li>
							<li>Would they want to use a pill taking app?</li> 
							<li>What problems are we trying to solve with the app?</li>
							<li>How can we differentiate ourselves from our competitors? </li>
						</ul>

						<p>So we dug right into figuring this stuff out. Conducting interviews, surveys, creating a competitive analysis, and ideating with affinity boards and so on.
							To start off, let's answer the first question, who is our target audience? We went in with the assumption, of course, that people who need to take medicine regularly are our core audience.
							but we needed to know more about them. So we set out to interview a few people we know who rely on medicine daily. </p>

						<p> The interviews were really useful, we got a lot of insights from people of different age groups. But wait, have you noticed something? That's right. There are no men in this list. We tried our best to find men to interview but
							they all turned us down for some reason. Of course, just because we only got interview data from women does not mean we are operating under the assumption that only women would want to use this kind of app. (And we got men in our survey data, so no worries there.)
							But it would have been really nice to get a man's perspective going into this. 

							<br> <br> So with this we know a little more about the people we're trying to help, but do they want our help? Are pill taking apps viable?

						<p> You can see from this data that most people remember to take their medicine, however...

				<section class="bio_text">
	
							
						<p> The reason why people are able to remember in the first place is because most of them use visual reminders
							to ensure that they don't miss a dose. Of course, thinking ahead we also asked if people are currently using an
							app to remind themselves, which 18% said they do. So yes, there is certainly a market for a pill reminder app, 
							and there is certainly wiggle room to compete in that space.
